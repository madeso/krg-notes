## yield return coroutine
> It's just a coroutine where you wait on the conditions to go to the next state with yields
> The one thing coroutines break down with is non-trivial control flow and needing to react to external events (like collisions and such) If the logic of the entity is dictated by those, I pull out a full explicit statemachine to do the logic The former can sometimes be managed with nested coroutines if they make sense, but the latter is an inherent weakness

* root: at the top
* selector: execute one child
* sequence: execute children in sequence
* leaf: performs actions

```java
protected void initSequence(List<Action> steps) {
	steps.add(new GotoWait(reception, 2));
	steps.add(new Wait(3.0f));
	steps.add(new GotoDo(emtpy_seat, new EatingAnimation(mover)));
	steps.add(new Goto(entrance_node));
}

class Wait implements Action {
	public void update();
	public boolean isFinished();
	public void init();
	public void finish();
}
// TimedAction implements action for a time
//   essentially setting the yaw, pitch, roll for a local transformation from a few easing animations
// LoopAction performs a action N times
```
